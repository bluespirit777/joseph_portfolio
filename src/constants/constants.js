    title: 'SIEM Home Lab',
    description: "In this project, I configured Elastic Stack SIEM in a home lab environment, deploying a Kali Linux virtual machine and setting up Elastic Agents for log collection and forwarding data for security monitoring. Using Nmap, I simulated and analyzed security events, querying the SIEM to identify and investigate incidents. Additionally, I designed a custom dashboard to visualize security events and created alert rules to detect specific threats. This project enhanced my skills in network security monitoring, threat detection, and incident response while demonstrating my ability to work with advanced cybersecurity tools.",

    title: 'Active Directory Home Lab',
    description:"In this project, I created an Active Directory home lab, incorporating Splunk, Kali Linux, and Atomic Red Team. This setup allowed me to simulate a domain environment, manage and troubleshoot network configurations, and ingest event data into a SIEM. Additionally, I generated attack-related telemetry to detect and analyze potential cyber threats. This experience not only enhances my cybersecurity skills but also demonstrates my ability to manage IT infrastructure.",

    title: 'Wireshark for Basic Network Security Analysis',
    description: "In this project, I used Wireshark for network traffic analysis by capturing and analyzing both encrypted and unencrypted traffic. I explored protocols such as RADIUS, HTTP, DNS, and Telnet by generating and capturing their traffic. Additionally, I worked with secure protocols like HTTPS and SSH, including capturing and decrypting HTTPS traffic using a pre-master secret key. This project highlights my ability to analyze and interpret network traffic.",

    title: 'Building a Home Network with Cisco Packet Tracer',
    description: "In this project, I designed and configured a home network using Cisco Packet Tracer, simulating a residential setup with a Cisco 2911 router, a Cisco 2960 switch, and multiple end devices. I configured the router with a static IP address and assigned IPs to the end devices, ensuring seamless connectivity through extensive testing. Additionally, I implemented basic security measures by setting up Access Control Lists (ACLs) on the router.",
