    title: 'SQL Customer Support Ticketing System',
    description: "In this project, I developed a customer support ticketing system using SQL to manage and track support tickets effectively. I designed and implemented a relational database with tables for users, tickets, comments, and ticket statuses. Key functionalities included ticket submission, status updates, comment addition, and report generation. I created and executed SQL queries for core operations and integrated the database with a user interface to facilitate seamless interaction.",

    title: 'Active Directory Home Lab',
    description:"In this project, I created an Active Directory home lab, incorporating Splunk, Kali Linux, and Atomic Red Team. This setup allowed me to simulate a domain environment, manage and troubleshoot network configurations, and ingest event data into a SIEM. Additionally, I generated attack-related telemetry to detect and analyze potential cyber threats. This experience not only enhances my cybersecurity skills but also demonstrates my ability to manage IT infrastructure.",

    title: 'Wireshark for Basic Network Security Analysis',
    description: "In this project, I used Wireshark for network traffic analysis by capturing and analyzing both encrypted and unencrypted traffic. I explored protocols such as RADIUS, HTTP, DNS, and Telnet by generating and capturing their traffic. Additionally, I worked with secure protocols like HTTPS and SSH, including capturing and decrypting HTTPS traffic using a pre-master secret key. This project highlights my ability to analyze and interpret network traffic.",

    title: 'Building a Home Network with Cisco Packet Tracer',
    description: "In this project, I designed and configured a home network using Cisco Packet Tracer, simulating a residential setup with a Cisco 2911 router, a Cisco 2960 switch, and multiple end devices. I configured the router with a static IP address and assigned IPs to the end devices, ensuring seamless connectivity through extensive testing. Additionally, I implemented basic security measures by setting up Access Control Lists (ACLs) on the router.",
